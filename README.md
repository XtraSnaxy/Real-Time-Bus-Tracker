# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
# Description
This project follows the bus path between M.I.T University and Harvard University. The program uses a GL JavaScript library from Mapbox, and contains markers that follow the bus stops in between the universities.

# How To Use
Once the link is clicked on the "Projects" page, the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button and map appear. Click the button to start the animation.

# Future Improvements
My future plans for the project is for it to be able to call other bus routes across different cities.
